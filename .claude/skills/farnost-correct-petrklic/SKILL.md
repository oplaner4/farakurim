# Correct a Petrklíč issue

The id comes from the year, number and note (`2026-2`, `2026-3-mimoradne`). Files on the server are never
overwritten, so `pnpm stage petrklic --corrected` stages a corrected PDF of a released issue in a new folder.

## 1. Find the issue

Take the issue the user names (or the corrected PDF's cover shows) from `src/content/petrklic.json`: its year, number
and note. When it fits several issues or none, list the candidates (id, year, number, note) and ask.

## 2. A corrected PDF

```sh
pnpm stage petrklic "<source>" --year <year> --number <number> [--note "<note>"] --corrected --check
```

It refuses an issue that is not in the file. Show the user the id, the folder it would stage, the rev and the page
count it prints (next to the record's old `pageCount`).

Wait for the user's yes or corrections to these before staging anything. Then stage it without `--check`:

```sh
pnpm stage petrklic "<source>" --year <year> --number <number> [--note "<note>"] --corrected
```

It renders the cover and pages again and updates the issue.

## 3. A wrong year, number, note or page count

Edit the issue's record in `src/content/petrklic.json`, then run `pnpm test src/content/petrklic`. A new year, number
or note changes the id, so the issue's folder in `uploads/petrklic/` must be renamed to the new id (with its
`-r<rev>` if it has one), and the PDF in it to `petrklic-<id>.pdf`. A released issue's new folder is uploaded as a
whole; tell the user the old folder stays on the server.

## 4. Publish

Follow **`farnost-publish-content`**.

## Common mistakes

- Replacing the PDF in an issue's folder by hand: the server keeps the old files, so stage it with `--corrected`.
- Staging a corrected PDF without `--corrected`: it is refused as an issue already in the file.
- Renaming the record's id without renaming its folder and PDF: the covers, the viewer and the download break.
